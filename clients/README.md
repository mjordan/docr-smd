# docr/smd Clients

## Overview

docr/smd is intended to use client apps running on mobile devices. Clients for Android and iOS, using the Tesseract (https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) library are currently under development.

A simple Python client is included in order to illustrate the high-level functionality of docr/smd clients. This client can also be used to test docr/smd page servers.
